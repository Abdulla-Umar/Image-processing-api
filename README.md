#1.Use (npm run build) to build the app

#2.Use (npm run jasmine) to test the app

#3.Use (npm run lint) to use eslint package

#4.Use (npm run prettier) to use prettire package

#You can use the app by input this link (api/images?filename=filename&width=anynumber&height=anynumber)
##use any of thes filenames(palmtunnel - fjord - icelandwaterfall - encenadaport - santamonica)
##for example => (api/images?filename=palmtunnel&width=600&height=400)



#I need answers to some questions
##- I always get an error when i try to start the app in my computer (can't install sharp module) so I write the all the code on codesandbox website.
##- How can i cashe the images in a specific folder using the fs module or anyway esle?
##- I tried to use the matcher (.tohaveproperty ) in testing but it gives me an error (doesn't exist on type Matchers <outputInfo>)
##- I have an error also when run the test (async function didn't complete within 5000ms) and I couldn't fix it
  
  
#Thank you
